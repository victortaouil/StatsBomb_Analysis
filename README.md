 In this Branch I have the main goal to analyze Messi's final world cup match. 

 The first analysis took place on how Messi's passes developed during the game. We can notice that his passes changes due the side of the pitch it takes place. 
 It's also interesting to notice his errors in passes, which are in red and his right passes are in green.
